      <h5>The Early Era: Inception to 19th Century</h5>
      <p>The history of photography began in the early 19th century with the invention of processes like the
        daguerreotype and ambrotype. The daguerreotype, developed by Louis Daguerre in 1839, produced highly detailed
        images on polished silver-plated copper sheets. Ambrotypes followed in the 1850s, creating images on glass.
        These early methods were labor-intensive and costly, making photography a luxury accessible only to the wealthy.

        <h5>The Film Era: Late 19th Century to Mid-20th Century</h5>
        <p>The late 19th century saw significant advancements with the introduction of roll film, pioneered by George
          Eastman in 1888 with the Kodak camera. This innovation made photography more accessible and user-friendly,
          allowing amateurs to take pictures and send the film to be developed. By the mid-20th century, film
          photography had become mainstream, with improvements in film quality and the introduction of 35mm film, making
          cameras more compact and affordable.</p>

      <h5>The Digital Era: Late 20th Century to Present</h5>
      <p>The late 20th century marked the beginning of the digital revolution in photography. The first digital cameras
        emerged in the 1980s, and by the 1990s, they had started to gain popularity. Digital cameras offered the
        advantage of instant image review and eliminated the need for film development. The 21st century saw rapid
        advancements in digital technology, with smartphones integrating high-quality cameras, making photography an
        integral part of everyday life for millions of people worldwide.</p>
